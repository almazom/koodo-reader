# Text Summarization Requirements

## Overview

The text summarization feature will enable users to generate concise summaries of book chapters or entire books using LLM technology. This document outlines the detailed requirements for implementation.

## User Stories

1. As a reader, I want to get a quick summary of a chapter before reading it, so I can decide if it's relevant to my interests.
2. As a student, I want to summarize key sections of a textbook, so I can review material more efficiently.
3. As a researcher, I want to generate summaries of entire reference books, so I can determine if they're worth a deeper reading.
4. As a casual reader, I want to recap previous chapters, so I can refresh my memory before continuing a book I haven't read in a while.

  - Length of summary
  - Focus area (plot, characters, themes, etc.)
  - Level of detail
  - Inclusion/exclusion of specific elements

### User Interface

- **F-SUM-05**: The system shall provide a clean, intuitive interface for accessing summarization features:
  - Chapter context menu option
  - Dedicated summarization button in the reader interface
  - Option in the book information panel

- **F-SUM-06**: The system shall display a progress indicator during summarization processing, showing:
  - Percentage complete
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Cancel option

- **F-SUM-07**: The system shall present summaries in a readable format:
  - Proper typography and formatting
  - Section breaks for longer summaries
  - Optional highlighting of key points
  - Ability to copy text to clipboard

### Storage and Management

- **F-SUM-08**: The system shall store generated summaries persistently:
  - Associated with the specific book and chapters
  - Retrievable across reading sessions
  - Accessible offline after generation

- **F-SUM-09**: The system shall allow users to:
  - Save multiple summary versions
  - Delete unwanted summaries
  - Export summaries (plain text, PDF)
  - Share summaries (copy link, email)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **NF-SUM-01**: The system shall generate chapter summaries within 30 seconds for typical chapter lengths (5,000-10,000 words).
- **NF-SUM-02**: The system shall generate whole book summaries within 3 minutes for typical books (50,000-100,000 words).
- **NF-SUM-03**: The system shall remain responsive during summarization processing.
- **NF-SUM-04**: The system shall efficiently handle large texts through chunking and progressive processing.

### Reliability

- **NF-SUM-05**: The system shall handle interruptions gracefully:
  - Resume processing if possible
  - Save partial results when appropriate
  - Provide clear error messages when generation fails

- **NF-SUM-06**: The system shall validate input text to ensure it's appropriate for summarization:
  - Minimum text length requirements
  - Content type verification
  - Language detection

### Security and Privacy

- **NF-SUM-07**: The system shall:
  - Inform users when text is being sent to external services
  - Provide options for on-device processing when available
  - Not store sent text on external servers longer than necessary
  - Anonymize usage data

## Technical Requirements

### LLM Integration

- **T-SUM-01**: The system shall integrate with at least one cloud-based LLM provider:
  - OpenAI API (primary)
  - Anthropic Claude (secondary)
  - Alternative providers as backup options

- **T-SUM-02**: The system shall implement effective prompt engineering:
  - Clear instructions for summary generation
  - Context provision for maintaining accuracy
  - Format specifications for consistent output
  - Guardrails against hallucination

- **T-SUM-03**: The system shall support on-device summarization (where applicable):
  - Integration with smaller, efficient models
  - Progressive loading of model components
  - Performance optimization for mobile devices

### Text Processing

- **T-SUM-04**: The system shall properly extract and prepare text for summarization:
  - HTML/CSS cleanup from EPUB content
  - Handling of special characters and formatting
  - Proper paragraph and section recognition
  - Identification of chapter boundaries

- **T-SUM-05**: The system shall implement chunking strategies for long content:
  - Intelligent text segmentation
  - Preservation of context across chunks
  - Re-assembly of summarized chunks
  - Maintaining narrative flow

### Caching and Optimization

- **T-SUM-06**: The system shall implement caching mechanisms:
  - Store summaries in IndexedDB
  - Avoid redundant API calls for previously summarized content
  - Implement version control for summaries if book content changes

- **T-SUM-07**: The system shall optimize API usage:
  - Minimize token consumption
  - Batch processing when appropriate
  - Usage tracking and limits

## Implementation Considerations

### Prompt Templates

For effective summarization, the following prompt template structure is recommended:

```
Task: Summarize the following text from "{book_title}" {chapter_info} in a {summary_type} format.

Text:
{text_content}

Instructions:
1. Create a {length} summary that captures the main ideas, key events, and important concepts.
2. Focus on {focus_areas}.
3. Format the summary as {format_type}.
4. Maintain the original meaning and factual accuracy.
5. Include {specific_elements} in your summary.

Output:
```

### Chunking Strategy

For content exceeding token limits:

1. Divide text into semantic chunks (preserving paragraph/section boundaries)
2. Summarize each chunk individually
3. Provide context between chunks to maintain continuity
4. Summarize the combined chunk summaries for final output
5. Add metadata about the chunking process

### Error Handling

The system should handle these common failure scenarios:

1. Network connectivity issues during API calls
2. API rate limiting or quota exhaustion
3. Invalid or unsuitable content for summarization
4. Interrupted processing due to application closure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Summaries maintain factual accuracy and key information from source text
2. Multiple summary types function as specified
3. Generation time meets performance requirements
4. Summaries are properly stored and retrievable across sessions
5. User interface is intuitive and provides appropriate feedback
6. Large books can be summarized without crashes or excessive delays
7. Customization options affect summary output appropriately
