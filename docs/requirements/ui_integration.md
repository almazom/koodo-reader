# UI Integration Requirements

## Overview

The UI Integration requirements define how LLM features will be seamlessly incorporated into the Koodo Reader interface while maintaining the clean, intuitive reading experience users expect. This document outlines detailed requirements for UI components, navigation, feedback mechanisms, and visual design considerations.

## User Stories

1. As a reader, I want intuitive access to AI features without disrupting my reading experience, so I can enhance my understanding without losing immersion.
2. As a mobile user, I want responsive AI feature interfaces optimized for touch input, so I can use them effectively on smaller screens.
3. As a frequent user, I want consistent placement and behavior of AI controls, so I can quickly access features without searching.
4. As a new user, I want clear visual indications of AI feature availability, so I can discover capabilities without reading documentation.
5. As a user with accessibility needs, I want AI features to respect accessibility standards, so I can use them with screen readers or keyboard navigation.
