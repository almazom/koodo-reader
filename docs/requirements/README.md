# Koodo Reader LLM Integration Requirements

## Overview

This folder contains the requirements documentation for integrating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities into Koodo Reader. The requirements are based on stakeholder interviews, technical analysis of the existing codebase, and research on LLM integration best practices.

## Document Structure

The requirements are organized into several categories:

### Core Requirements

- [Core Features](./core_features.md) - Overview of the LLM features and their priorities
- [API Integration](./api_integration.md) - Requirements for integrating with LLM providers
- [Chapter Summarization](./chapter_summarization.md) - Detailed requirements for the highest priority feature

### Technical Requirements

- [Storage](./storage.md) - Requirements for storing LLM-generated content
- [UI Integration](./ui_integration.md) - Requirements for integrating LLM features into the user interface
- [Performance](./performance.md) - Performance requirements for LLM features

### Future Features

- [Question Answering](./question_answering.md) - Requirements for Q&A functionality
- [Podcast Generation](./podcast_generation.md) - Requirements for converting text to audio content

## Key Design Principles

These requirements follow several key design principles:

1. **User Control**: Users should explicitly request LLM features rather than having them activated automatically
2. **Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)**: Users provide their own API keys for LLM services
3. **Mobile-First**: UI design prioritizes mobile experience, especially Android
4. **Leverage Existing UI**: Integrate with existing Koodo Reader components rather than creating new UI patterns
5. **Persistence**: Store generated content for future access
6. **Clear Indicators**: Provide clear visual indicators for available LLM content

## Development Approach

The recommended approach is to implement these features in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: API integration and chapter summarization
2. **Phase 2**: Additional LLM features (Q&A, content analysis)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (podcast generation, multi-model support)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript (existing Koodo Reader stack)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (existing Koodo Reader storage)
- **APIs**: Multiple LLM providers (DeepSeek, Gwen, Minimax, Gemini)

## Functional Requirements Summary

| ID | Feature | Priority | Description |
|----|---------|----------|-------------|

| F-API | API Integration | High | Connect to multiple LLM providers with user-provided keys |
| F-STOR | LLM Content Storage | High | Persistently store generated content |
| F-QA | Question Answering | Medium | Allow users to ask questions about text content |
| F-POD | Podcast Generation | Low | Convert text to audio with enhanced features |

## Non-Functional Requirements Summary

| ID | Category | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| NF-PERF | Performance | Response times, resource usage |
| NF-SEC | Security | API key storage, data protection |
| NF-REL | Reliability | Error handling, recovery mechanisms |
| NF-COMP | Compatibility | Cross-platform behavior |
| NF-ACC | Accessibility | Standards compliance, inclusive design |
