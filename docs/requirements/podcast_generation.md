# Podcast Generation Requirements

## Overview

The Podcast Generation feature will enable users to convert book content into audio format with enhanced listening features, leveraging Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies and optional LLM processing for content optimization. This document outlines the detailed requirements for implementation.

## User Stories

1. As a commuter, I want to listen to book chapters during my travel, so I can make productive use of my time without reading.
2. As a multitasker, I want to convert book content to audio, so I can consume content while doing other activities.
3. As a person with visual impairments, I want high-quality audio versions of books, so I can enjoy content that might not be available in commercial audiobook format.
4. As a language learner, I want to listen to books at adjustable speeds, so I can practice comprehension skills.
5. As a content creator, I want to generate podcast-like renditions of public domain books, so I can share them with my audience.

## Implementation Considerations

### TTS Service Selection

The choice of TTS service should consider:

1. **Voice quality**: Naturalness and expressiveness
2. **Language support**: Coverage of book content languages
3. **Cost structure**: Pay-per-character vs. subscription
4. **Integration complexity**: API simplicity and reliability
5. **Offline capabilities**: Availability of on-device solutions

### Multi-Voice Management

For books with dialogue, the system should:

1. Identify dialogue sections through punctuation and paragraphing
2. Maintain consistent voice assignment for characters
3. Use voice metadata to select appropriately contrasting voices
4. Allow manual override of automatic voice assignments
5. Provide simpler single-voice option for performance/cost reasons

### Audio Format Considerations

| Format | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best For |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| MP3 | Universal compatibility, smaller size | Limited metadata, no native chapter support | Quick listening, sharing |
| M4A/M4B | Chapter support, better compression, rich metadata | Less universal support | Full book conversion, organized listening |
| WAV | Highest quality, uncompressed | Very large file size | Short segments requiring highest quality |

### Error Handling

The system should handle these common failure scenarios:

1. TTS service connectivity issues
2. API rate limiting or quota exhaustion
3. Insufficient storage space
4. Malformed text that causes TTS processing errors
5. Device limitations for audio processing
6. Background process termination by OS

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Audio generation completes within the specified performance requirements
2. Voice quality is natural and pronunciation is generally accurate
3. Audio player functions correctly with all controls operating as expected
4. Chapter navigation works precisely and maintains position
5. Generated audio files persist across application sessions
6. Audio can be generated in the background while the user performs other tasks
7. Text synchronization highlights the correct text during playback
