# Question & Answering Requirements

## Overview

The Question & Answering (Q&A) feature will enable users to ask questions about selected text, chapters, or entire books and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers generated by LLM technology. This document outlines the detailed requirements for implementation.

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to ask clarifying questions about complex passages, so I can better understand the material.
2. As a researcher, I want to extract specific information from technical texts, so I can efficiently find relevant details.
3. As a book club member, I want to generate discussion questions about chapters, so I can prepare for meetings.
4. As a language learner, I want to ask about unfamiliar vocabulary and expressions, so I can improve my comprehension.
5. As a teacher, I want to create study guides with questions and answers, so I can help students review key concepts.

  - Delete unwanted conversations
  - Share specific answers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **NF-QA-01**: The system shall generate answers to standard questions within 5 seconds.
- **NF-QA-02**: The system shall remain responsive during answer generation.
- **NF-QA-03**: The system shall handle multiple Q&A sessions without performance degradation.
- **NF-QA-04**: The system shall optimize token usage to reduce API costs and response times.

### Reliability

- **NF-QA-05**: The system shall handle connectivity interruptions gracefully:
  - Cache questions for later processing
  - Resume answer generation when possible
  - Provide clear error messages when generation fails

- **NF-QA-06**: The system shall validate inputs:
  - Ensure questions have sufficient context
  - Check for question clarity and completeness
  - Identify when selected text is insufficient for accurate answers

### Security and Privacy

- **NF-QA-07**: The system shall:
  - Inform users when text is being sent to external services
  - Provide options for on-device processing when available
  - Not store sent text on external servers longer than necessary
  - Allow users to delete conversation history permanently

## Technical Requirements

### LLM Integration

- **T-QA-01**: The system shall integrate with at least one cloud-based LLM provider:
  - OpenAI API (primary)
  - Anthropic Claude (secondary)
  - Alternative providers as backup options

- **T-QA-02**: The system shall implement effective prompt engineering:
  - Clear instructions for answer generation
  - Context provision for accuracy
  - Format specifications for consistent output
  - Constraints to prevent hallucination
  - Citation instructions for referencing source text

- **T-QA-03**: The system shall support on-device question answering (where applicable):
  - Integration with smaller, efficient models
  - Optimization for common question types
  - Progressive loading of model components

### Context Management

- **T-QA-04**: The system shall effectively manage context for questions:
  - Determine appropriate context window based on selection
  - Expand context when necessary for complete understanding
  - Maintain conversation history for follow-up questions
  - Implement context window management for LLM token limits

- **T-QA-05**: The system shall implement smart text selection:
  - Extract full sentences when partial selections are made
  - Include surrounding paragraphs for additional context
  - Identify and include relevant earlier references
  - Apply heuristics to select contextually complete passages

### Answer Enhancement

- **T-QA-06**: The system shall enhance answer quality:
  - Post-process answers for formatting consistency
  - Add citations to specific book locations
  - Validate answers against source material when possible
  - Provide confidence indicators for answers

- **T-QA-07**: The system shall implement caching mechanisms:
  - Store common questions and answers
  - Avoid redundant API calls for similar questions
  - Implement context-aware retrieval

## Implementation Considerations

### Prompt Templates

For effective question answering, the following prompt template structure is recommended:

```
Task: Answer the following question based on the provided context from "{book_title}" {chapter_info}.

Context:
{selected_text_or_chapter_content}

Question:
{user_question}

Instructions:
1. Answer the question using only information from the provided context.
2. If the answer cannot be determined from the context, clearly state that.
3. Include specific references to locations in the text that support your answer.
4. Format your answer in {format_type}.
5. Avoid adding information not present in the context.

Previous Conversation (if applicable):
{conversation_history}

Output:
```

### Context Window Management

For questions requiring large context windows:

1. Determine the relevant context span for the question
2. If context exceeds token limits:
   - Use semantic chunking to divide context
   - Process question against each chunk
   - Combine and refine answers if multiple chunks contain relevant information
   - Indicate which parts of the text were most relevant

### Error Handling

The system should handle these common failure scenarios:

1. Questions without sufficient context
2. Questions outside the scope of the provided text
3. Network connectivity issues during API calls
4. API rate limiting or quota exhaustion
5. User requests for information not present in the text

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Answers maintain factual accuracy based on the source text
2. Questions receive responses within the specified performance requirements
3. Multiple question types function as specified
4. Q&A history is properly stored and retrievable across sessions
5. The user interface provides intuitive access to Q&A features
6. Citation of source text locations is accurate and helpful
7. Follow-up questions maintain appropriate context
