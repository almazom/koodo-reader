# Research Documents Index

## Deep Research Documents

This repository contains a comprehensive set of documents analyzing and planning the integration of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities into Koodo Reader.

### Main Documentation

- [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) - Current project status and progress tracking

### Deep Research Directory

Location: [docs/deep_research/](deep_research/)

#### Overview Documents

- [index.md](deep_research/index.md) - Overview of all research documentation
- [research_summary.md](deep_research/research_summary.md) - Executive summary of key findings

#### Technical Analysis

- [open_source_options.md](deep_research/open_source_options.md) - Analysis of available open-source EPUB reader options
- [llm_integration.md](deep_research/llm_integration.md) - Technical approaches for LLM integration
- [podcast_generation.md](deep_research/podcast_generation.md) - Detailed exploration of podcast generation
- [technical_architecture.md](deep_research/technical_architecture.md) - Proposed architecture for integration

#### Planning Documents

- [implementation_plan.md](deep_research/implementation_plan.md) - Phased development timeline and tasks
- [license_considerations.md](deep_research/license_considerations.md) - License analysis and commercialization strategies

## Research Focus Areas

The research documents cover the following key areas:

1. **Foundation Selection** - Analysis of build vs. extend approaches
2. **Architecture Design** - Modular integration with existing codebase
3. **LLM Integration** - Cloud vs. on-device approaches
4. **Feature Implementation** - Technical details for summarization, Q&A, and podcast generation
5. **Business Considerations** - Licensing, commercialization, and cost management

## Key Conclusions

After extensive research, the recommended approach is:

1. Extend the existing Koodo Reader open-source project rather than building from scratch
2. Begin with cloud-based LLM API integration with plans for a hybrid approach
3. Follow a phased 6-10 month implementation plan
4. Consider a freemium model with API service provision for commercialization

## Next Steps

For development planning, refer to [implementation_plan.md](deep_research/implementation_plan.md) which outlines a detailed timeline and specific tasks for each project phase.
