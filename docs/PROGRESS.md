# Koodo Reader LLM Integration - Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Documentation & Planning
- **Date**: Last updated on: 2025-03-21
- **Milestone**: Core components documentation completed

## Recent Activities

- Conducted comprehensive research on approaches to integrate LLM features into Koodo Reader
- Analyzed various open-source EPUB readers for potential use as foundation
- Explored LLM integration options (cloud-based vs on-device)
- Researched TTS services for podcast generation feature
- Created detailed documentation in docs/deep_research directory
- **NEW**: Created comprehensive documentation for key components:
  - Reader Module (core rendering and navigation)
  - Text-to-Speech feature (potential podcast foundation)
  - Plugin System (extension point for LLM services)
  - Database Service (storage solution for LLM results)
  - Book Metadata Service (extracting and managing book data)

## Next Steps

- Complete documentation for remaining core components
- Define specific LLM integration points
- Create proof-of-concept for first LLM feature (summarization)
- Design database extensions for LLM data storage
- Evaluate API options and associated costs

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Database service will need extension to store LLM-generated content
