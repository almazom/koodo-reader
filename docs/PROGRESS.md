## Recent Activities

- Conducted comprehensive research on approaches to integrate LLM features into Koodo Reader
- Analyzed various open-source EPUB readers for potential use as foundation
- Explored LLM integration options (cloud-based vs on-device)
- Researched TTS services for podcast generation feature
- Created detailed documentation in docs/deep_research directory
- Created comprehensive documentation for key components:
  - Reader Module (core rendering and navigation)
  - Text-to-Speech feature (potential podcast foundation)
  - Plugin System (extension point for LLM services)
  - Database Service (storage solution for LLM results)
  - Book Metadata Service (extracting and managing book data)
- Successfully set up the development environment:
  - Implemented Docker-based configuration for Koodo Reader
  - Created automation script for easy container management
  - Resolved networking and port exposure issues
  - Verified application functionality in browser
  - Established reproducible workflow for development
- Created detailed architecture for Minimax LLM integration:
  - Designed flexible LLM service architecture
  - Created Russian prompt templates for summarization
  - Planned SQLite database schema for caching summaries
  - Designed UI integration using existing AI button
- Implemented initial components for LLM integration:
  - Created secure API key management system
  - Set up proper gitignore rules for sensitive data
  - Prepared template files for configuration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
- Continue implementation of Minimax LLM chapter summarization feature:
  - Implement the core LLM service architecture with strong typing
  - Create LLM provider interface and Minimax provider implementation
  - Develop chapter content extraction service
  - Implement SQLite storage for summaries
  - Integrate with AI floating button UI
- Create prompt management system with default Russian prompts
- Implement error handling with retries and fallbacks

### Short-term Goals
- Create LLM settings panel in the application settings
- Implement chapter content extraction for summarization
- Create summarization UI in the reader interface

### Infrastructure Improvements
1. Implement container monitoring system
2. Add HTTPS support for secure access
3. Create automated testing pipeline for Docker environment

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Docker-based development environment provides consistent and reproducible setup
- Our Docker setup now provides reliable access via both localhost and server IP 
- Minimax chapter summarization will be our first LLM feature, with a flexible architecture to add more LLM providers later
- API keys are carefully managed to ensure security and prevent accidental commits to version control
