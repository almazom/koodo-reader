## Android Build Progress (March 2025)

### Strategy 1: Using Capacitor with existing SDK tools
- ✅ Resolved Java version conflicts in Gradle files
- ✅ Fixed Java version references in `capacitor.build.gradle` file
- ✅ Updated Java version in `capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/build.gradle`
- ✅ Updated Capacitor configuration in `capacitor.config.ts`
- ✅ Resolved lockfile conflicts by removing `yarn.lock` and using npm
- ✅ Addressed SDK path issues by updating `local.properties`
- ⚠️ Ongoing issues with Android SDK licenses and components
- ❌ Failed due to missing build-tools version 30.0.3 and license acceptance issues

### Strategy 2: Alternative Approach - Using cordova-android
- 🔄 Planned approach to use Cordova instead of Capacitor
- 🔄 Will require installing Cordova globally and creating a new project
- 🔄 Need to copy web assets and configure for Android specifically

### Strategy 3: Using Android Studio
- 🔄 Plan to use Android Studio to handle SDK installations and license agreements
- 🔄 Would involve opening the project in Android Studio and building through the IDE

### Strategy 4: Docker-based build
- ✅ Created Dockerfile.android with Debian Bullseye Slim base image
- ✅ Implemented automated license acceptance in the Dockerfile
- ✅ Created docker-build-android.sh script to automate the build process
- ✅ Configured volume mount to extract the APK back to the host
- ✅ Fixed base image issue by switching to Debian for apt-get support
- ✅ Added proper documentation in docs/android-build-strategies.md
- 🔄 Ready to execute the Docker build process

### Next Steps for Android Build
- Created detailed documentation of all attempted strategies in `docs/android-build-strategies.md`
- Will execute the Docker-based build approach next
- Consider using commercial build services for cross-platform apps if Docker approach fails
- Continue recording all approaches and lessons learned

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Docker-based development environment provides consistent and reproducible setup
- Our Docker setup now provides reliable access via both localhost and server IP 
- Minimax chapter summarization will be our first LLM feature, with a flexible architecture to add more LLM providers later
- API keys are carefully managed to ensure security and prevent accidental commits to version control
- Russian haiku generation is used as a lightweight test for the LLM API integration
