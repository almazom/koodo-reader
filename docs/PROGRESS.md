# Koodo Reader LLM Integration - Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Initial Implementation
- **Date**: Last updated on: 2025-03-22
- **Milestone**: Redux integration for LLM features completed

## Recent Activities

- Conducted comprehensive research on approaches to integrate LLM features into Koodo Reader
- Analyzed various open-source EPUB readers for potential use as foundation
- Explored LLM integration options (cloud-based vs on-device)
- Researched TTS services for podcast generation feature
- Created detailed documentation in docs/deep_research directory
- Created comprehensive documentation for key components:
  - Reader Module (core rendering and navigation)
  - Text-to-Speech feature (potential podcast foundation)
  - Plugin System (extension point for LLM services)
  - Database Service (storage solution for LLM results)
  - Book Metadata Service (extracting and managing book data)
- **NEW**: Implemented core Redux state management for LLM features:
  - Created LLM model classes (LLMConfig, LLMSummary)
  - Implemented LLM database service for persistence
  - Created LLM API service for provider integration
  - Added Redux actions and reducers for LLM state management
  - Created dedicated feature branch for LLM integration work

## Next Steps

- Develop UI components for LLM configuration management
- Create LLM settings panel in the application settings
- Implement chapter content extraction for summarization
- Create summarization UI in the reader interface
- Implement API call handling with error management
- Add loading indicators for LLM operations

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Using dedicated feature branch (feature/llm-integration) for all LLM-related development
- Following a modular approach with clear separation between UI, state management, and API services
