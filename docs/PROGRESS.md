3. Create automated testing pipeline for Docker environment

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Docker-based development environment provides consistent and reproducible setup
- Our Docker setup now provides reliable access via both localhost and server IP 
- Minimax chapter summarization will be our first LLM feature, with a flexible architecture to add more LLM providers later
- API keys are carefully managed to ensure security and prevent accidental commits to version control
- Russian haiku generation is used as a lightweight test for the LLM API integration
