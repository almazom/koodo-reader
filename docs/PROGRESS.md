- **User Experience**: Improved with better feedback and accessibility

## Recent Activities

- Conducted comprehensive research on approaches to integrate LLM features into Koodo Reader
- Analyzed various open-source EPUB readers for potential use as foundation
- Explored LLM integration options (cloud-based vs on-device)
- Researched TTS services for podcast generation feature
- Created detailed documentation in docs/deep_research directory
- Created comprehensive documentation for key components:
  - Reader Module (core rendering and navigation)
  - Text-to-Speech feature (potential podcast foundation)
  - Plugin System (extension point for LLM services)
  - Database Service (storage solution for LLM results)
  - Book Metadata Service (extracting and managing book data)
- Successfully set up the development environment:
  - Implemented Docker-based configuration for Koodo Reader
  - Created automation script for easy container management
  - Resolved networking and port exposure issues
  - Verified application functionality in browser
  - Established reproducible workflow for development

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
- Create LLM models and database service implementation
- Implement Redux state management for LLM features
- Develop UI components for LLM configuration management

### Short-term Goals
- Create LLM settings panel in the application settings
- Implement chapter content extraction for summarization
- Create summarization UI in the reader interface

### Infrastructure Improvements
1. Implement container monitoring system
2. Add HTTPS support for secure access
3. Create automated testing pipeline for Docker environment

## Blockers

- None identified yet

## Notes

- Primary focus will be extending Koodo Reader with LLM capabilities rather than starting from scratch
- Key LLM features to implement: chapter/book summarization, Q&A on selected text, podcast generation
- Plugin system appears to be the most promising integration point for LLM services
- Docker-based development environment provides consistent and reproducible setup
- Our Docker setup now provides reliable access via both localhost and server IP
