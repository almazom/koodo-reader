# AI Button and Side Drawer Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement the AI Button and Side Drawer UI from prototype 09-side-drawer.html into the Koodo Reader codebase. The implementation will follow existing code patterns and maintain consistency with the application's design.

## Cross-Platform Considerations

- **Desktop**: Support for mouse hover interactions and keyboard shortcuts
- **Web**: Compatible with different browsers and screen sizes
- **Mobile**: Touch-friendly with appropriate gesture support
- **Responsive**: Adapts to both portrait and landscape orientations

## Implementation Checklist

### Investigation Phase
- [x] Examine main app structure to identify integration points
- [x] Study existing UI components for consistent styling
- [x] Identify React component patterns used in the codebase
- [x] Check for existing drawer implementations we could leverage
