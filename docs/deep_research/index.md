# LLM Integration for EPUB Reader - Research Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive research on integrating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities into Koodo Reader, an open-source EPUB reader application. The research explores various approaches, technical considerations, and implementation strategies.

## Key Recommendations

The research concludes with the following key recommendations:

1. **Foundation Approach**: Extend Koodo Reader rather than building a new EPUB reader from scratch
2. **LLM Strategy**: Begin with cloud-based API integration (OpenAI/Claude) with plans for hybrid approach
3. **Implementation Timeline**: Follow a phased 6-10 month implementation plan 
4. **Commercialization Strategy**: Consider freemium model with API service provision

## Next Steps

To move forward with this project:

1. Set up development environment with Koodo Reader codebase
2. Analyze the architecture and identify integration points
3. Create a basic proof-of-concept for summarization feature
4. Begin implementation following the phased approach in the implementation plan
