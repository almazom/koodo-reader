# EPUB Reader with LLM Features - Research Summary

## Introduction

This document summarizes comprehensive research on developing an EPUB reader application enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. The primary focus is on evaluating whether to build a new application from scratch or extend an existing open-source EPUB reader, specifically Koodo Reader.

## Key Findings

### Development Approach

After analyzing multiple expert perspectives, there is strong consensus that **extending an existing open-source EPUB reader** is significantly more efficient than building from scratch. Key reasons include:

1. **Complex EPUB handling**: Parsing and rendering EPUB files (compressed archives with HTML, CSS, and metadata) requires significant development effort
2. **Focus on differentiation**: Using an existing reader allows development resources to focus on LLM features rather than basic functionality
3. **Cross-platform considerations**: Several mature open-source options support multiple platforms

### Recommended Open-Source Foundation

The most recommended options across all analyses are:

1. **Koodo Reader** (Primary recommendation)
   - Cross-platform (Web, desktop, Android, iOS)
   - Modern architecture with active development
   - Existing AI features to build upon
   - 21.5k+ GitHub stars
   - AGPL-3.0 license

2. **Alternative options by platform**:
   - **Android**: Librera Reader (Java/Kotlin, 10M+ downloads)
   - **iOS**: FolioReaderKit (Swift framework)
   - **Cross-platform**: Readest (Next.js/Tauri based)

### LLM Integration Approaches

Two primary approaches were identified:

1. **Cloud-based API approach**
   - **Services**: OpenAI, Claude, PaLM
   - **Pros**: Highest quality results, no device limitations
   - **Cons**: Requires internet, potential costs, privacy concerns

2. **On-device inference**
   - **Models**: Smaller versions (1-7B parameters) like Gemma, Llama 3
   - **Pros**: Works offline, no API costs, better privacy
   - **Cons**: Lower quality, device resource limitations

3. **Hybrid approach** (recommended for future phases)
   - Basic features locally, advanced features via cloud
   - Balances capabilities while managing limitations

### Podcast Generation

Text-to-Speech (TTS) services recommended for podcast generation:
- **Cloud options**: Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly, ElevenLabs
- **Selection criteria**: Voice quality, language support, cost structure

### Technical Architecture

For cross-platform development, these approaches were evaluated:
- **React Native with WebView**: Uses epub.js for rendering
- **Flutter**: Single codebase with EPUB plugins
- **Native development**: Platform-specific (Kotlin/Swift)

### Implementation Timeline

Estimated development timeline: **6-10 months total**
- Phase 1 (2-3 months): Foundation setup
- Phase 2 (2-3 months): Core LLM features
- Phase 3 (1-2 months): Advanced features
- Phase 4 (1-2 months): iOS support and refinement

## License Considerations

Using Koodo Reader (AGPL-3.0 license) requires:
- Making source code available when distributing the application
- Maintaining the same license for modifications
- Proper attribution to original authors

## Next Steps

1. Analyze Koodo Reader's architecture and codebase
2. Identify integration points for LLM features
3. Develop proof-of-concept for summarization feature
4. Evaluate API options and potential costs
5. Create detailed implementation plan
